[1] Aiger D ,  Talbot H . The Phase Only Transform for unsupervised surface defect detection.  2013.

This approach is a simple, fast, and effective method to detect defects on textured surfaces. It is unsupervised and contains no learning stage or information on the
texture being inspected. This method is based on the Phase Only Transform (PHOT) which correspond to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), normalized by the magnitude.

## difference
Original paper used Mahalanobis distance to judge the area of defect, I just judge each pixel.
